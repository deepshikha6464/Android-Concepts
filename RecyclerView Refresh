onBindHolder called several times
as Recycler View needs a view unless new one. 
So each time you set visilibity in child views, other views states are also changes.

Whenever you scroll up and down,
these views are getting re-drawed with wrong visibility options 

so to overcome this problem use this code inside the onBindViewHolder()
//*******************
holder.setIsRecyclable(false);
//**********************
